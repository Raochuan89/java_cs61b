1.  Double link list with sentinel's code looks cleaner:
    for insert: no need to deal with empty list case (never empty)
    for remove: no need to take care of size 1, otherwise will have null
    pointer violation

2.  Double link list is trickier to implement:
    when insert or remove, draw a general case, NOT boundary case; a.k.a. for
    insert (size=1, excluding sentinel), while for delete (size =2, excluding
    sentinel). It will work for boundary case like a charm

    It will be important to know which link to break, the rule is not to lose
    node when breaking!

3.  Discussion for size=0 when remove is always needed
